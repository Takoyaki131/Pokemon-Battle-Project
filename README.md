# Pokemon-Battle-Project
 Personal project that attempts to create the battle portion of a pokmeon game. This will be done through console and will attempt a GUI version later.
Using pokemon wikis as references to some game mechanics. Included the basics from Gen 1 to keep it as minimal as possible and will add features from later generations later. Some formulas needed for the battle are taken from the wiki and are referenced in the code comments when they appear. First attempt at making a medium/large sized program.
