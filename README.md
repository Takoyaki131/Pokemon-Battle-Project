# Pokemon-Battle-Project
 Personal project that attempts to create the battle portion of a pokmeon game. This done through console and will attempt a GUI version later.
Trying to use only my own thinking to create how a pokemon battle is coded. Included the basics from Gen 1 to keep it as minimal as possible and will add features from later generations later. Some formulas needed for the battle are taken from the wiki and are referenced in the code comments when they appear.
